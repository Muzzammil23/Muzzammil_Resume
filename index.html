                PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY: As an IT graduate, I have a strong foundation in information
                systems, programming, and network architecture. With an analytical mind-set and technical
                skills, I can design and implement innovative solutions to complex problems. I also excel at
                collaborating with teams and communicating technical concepts to non-technical
                stakeholders. My expertise positions me well for roles in software engineering, data analysis,
                cybersecurity, and project management. I am eager to learn and grow as a professional in a
                dynamic and challenging environment.
